spec:
  adds:
    - "Research lanes: local MPLS restaurant closures + new startups; failed MN weed startups; food distributors (routes to corner stores); legacy businesses w/ margin leaks due to no-computers."
    - "Product idea: UPC/photo-to-price discovery across preferred retailers → CPI-adjacent signal + B2B wedge."
    - "Ingest: gut mt-news (rss sucker) into MT proper; normalize sources beyond RSS; evidence-first pipeline."
    - "Tooling: tiny stools only; consistent naming; split repo if MT grows too fast."
  guardrails:
    - "No targeted private-residence lookups in-chat; use official sources + evidence capture workflow when needed."
    - "Evidence is everything; verified evidence is gold; repeatable verified evidence is the model."
  next:
    - "Draft MT fetcher plan: fetch→evidence→normalize→summarize for public records + retail price snapshots."
    - "Define source registry format + freshness scoring hooks (mtime + git-touch age)."
