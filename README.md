## Purpose of This Repository

This repository contains a **modular, versioned investment thesis** designed to:
- Capture a coherent macro + market view
- Translate that view into portfolio construction
- Enforce strict separation between human reasoning, machine logic, and live data

This is a **decision framework**, not a signal service or prediction engine.

## Core Principles

1. Human-Readable (HR) thesis is the source of truth  
2. JSON and AGENT files are always derived  
3. DATA files never change logic  
4. Unverified claims are explicitly flagged  
5. Data overrides narrative, always
